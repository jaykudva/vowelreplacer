# Simple python script that takes in a text input and replaces all the vowels with "x" to make the words vxwxlxss

## To run
1. After pulling this repository, please `cd` into it.
2. Replace the text in `script.txt` with any text you'd like to use.
3. Run `python3 program.py`
4. Take the text from `write.txt`!

## Happy replacing!

(Thank you to [NJIT](https://web.njit.edu/~cm395/theBeeMovieScript/) for the script to the Bee Movie, which has been used as the placeholder text!)
